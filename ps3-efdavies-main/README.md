# Problem Set 3

Due the night of February 10th at midnight!

## Instructions
The homework pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Code for Problem 1 should be done in the `Prob1.py` file already in the repository
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. 
 	- Make sure you meet all your requirements!

#### Testing
Automated tests exist for all problems and will attempt to make sure everything is working properly and give you some feedback. As always, you should also do your own testing to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.
